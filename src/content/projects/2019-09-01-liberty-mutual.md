## Roles

I was hired at Liberty Mutual as part of a large initiative to start to transform their online servicing business to use modern web frameworks. Using the experience I gained while helping my friends with [Meta](/projects/meta) I was able to jump right into the Node back-end and had a ton of fun learning React + Redux for the front-end.

Liberty Mutual has also started to leverage a distributed Node.js microservice architecture using Docker, Hapi, Apache Kafka, traefik, Apache ZooKeeper, and consul.

## Technologies

Liberty Mutual uses NodeJS/ExpressJS for the back-end which leverages the existing SOAP and REST services as well as some new Node microservices. The front-end is now written in React leveraging Redux for state management.
